# jQuery Unscroll Timeline

Contact: Paul Ford <ford@ftrain.com>


## Goal

Create a general, accessible embeddable timeline for the web using
jQuery. Goes vertical as well as horizontal.

- Basic features [proposed]
  - Lays out arbitrary HTML5 objects, including embeds, on a large grid without overlap
  - Consumes live JSON or accessible HTML from multiple sources
  - Scrolls vertically/horizontally
  - Objects on screen are POHTML, remaining in jQuery ecosystem
  - Zooms
  - Parallax overview

## Current Status

This code is barely started pre-alpha and shouldn't be used for
anything ever.

## Directory Structure

- timeline/ - actual timeline
- submodules/ - submodule code

## Prior Art and Features

### Simile Timeline

  - <http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/>
  - Old reliable: Old, reliable
  - Spans/durations (perhaps as bg extenders -- see http://www.stripegenerator.com/
  - Parallax-scrolling mini-timeline
  - Not jQuery

### jQuery Timeline

  - <https://github.com/danielgwood/jquery-timeline.git>
  - New, pre-alpha
  - Nice scrolling with cursor keys
  - Clean,n o pictures
  - No auto-arranger or filler
  - Reliant on Canvas--less, hacky but means less ability to play
    with HTML/DOM-driven jQuery plugins.
